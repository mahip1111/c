// RECURSION:- 
// A function defined in C can call itself. This is called recursion. A function calling itself is also called ‘recursive’ function. 

// Example:-

// A very good example of recursion is factorial. 
// Factorial(n) = 1 x 2 x 3 … x n 
// Factorial(n) = 1 x 2 x3 … (n-1) x n 
// Factorial(n) =   Factorial (n-1) x n 
// Since we can write factorial of a number in terms of itself, we can program it using recursion. 


// IMPORTANT NOTES:-
//1. Recursion is often a direct way to implement certain algorithms, but not  always the most direct for every algorithm. Recursion is particularly suited for  problems that can be divided into smaller.

//2.  The condition in a recursive function that stops further recursion is called the base case. This correction clarifies that the base case is crucial as it prevents infinite recursion and ensures the function terminates correctly.

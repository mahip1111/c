//  LOOP CONTROL INSTRUCTION 

// WHY LOOPS:-
// Sometimes we want our programs to execute few sets of instructions over and over again.
// For example: Printing 1 to 100, first 100 even numbers etc. 
// Hence loops make it easy for a programmer to tell computer that a given set of 
// instructions must be executed repeatedly. 

// TYPES OF LOOPS:-
// Primarily there are three types of loops in C language: 
// 1. while loop 
// 2. do–while loop 
// 3. for loop

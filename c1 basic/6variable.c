// There are some rules which are applicable to all the C programs: 
// 1. Every program’s execution starts from main() function. 
// 2. All the statements are terminated with a semicolon. 
// 3. Instructions are case–sensitive. 
// 4. Instructions are executed in the same order in which they are written. 


// what are the library fxn. in c:-
// In C programming, library functions are built-in functions provided by the C standard library that help perform common tasks like input/output, string handling, mathematical computations, memory management, etc. These functions are defined in header files (like stdio.h, string.h, math.h, etc.) and save time by providing pre-written, tested code. Exapmle of such fxn's are:- printf() and scanf() and so on.

// TYPES OF VARIABLES 
// 1. Integer variables → int a=3; 
// 2. Real variables → int a=7; float a=7.7; 
// 3. Character variables → char a= ‘b’;

// NOTE:- CONSTANT AND VARIABLES IN C
// An entity whose value does not change is called as a constant. 
// A variable is an entity whose value can be changed. 
// Primarily, there are three types of constants: 
// 1. Integer Constant → 1,6,7,9 
// 2. Real Constant → 322.1, 2.5 ,7.0 
// 3. Character Constant → ‘a’, ‘$’, ‘@’ (must be enclosed within single quotes)

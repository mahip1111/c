// Recursion in C is a process in which a function calls itself — either directly or indirectly — to solve a smaller part of a larger problem. It continues until a specific base condition is met, which stops further recursive calls.

// scope of variable is local and global.

// a fucntion can contain more than two return statements like you make funcion and add if else and in if else you use return for each one, but note that only one return statement is executed only.

// NOTE: same name cannot be used for the different functions even though you change the return datatye or change the parameters bcz there is no concept of OOP'S in c. but c++ funciton overloading concept and other concepts are ther and also c++ is an object oriented programming language.

// NOTE: A funciton can call itself except the main().

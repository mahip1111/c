// Q: why c language is called as the block structurd language?\
// ans: C is called a block-structured programming language because it allows you to group multiple statements into a single unit (called a block) using curly braces { }. This block acts like one single statement and helps in organizing code clearly.

// Here are the key reasons:
// Reason                                  	      Explanation
// Use of { } to group statements	           C uses braces to create blocks of code that act as a single unit.
// Supports structured control flow	       Blocks are used in loops,etc. Helps create structured and readable programs.
// Variables can be declared inside blocks	   A variable declared inside a block is local to that block (scope).

// Q: what is block In C language: 
// ans: A block is a group of statements enclosed within curly braces { }. A block allows multiple statements to be treated as a single unit.

// NOTE: Jo outer block hota hai of all the inner block unhe hum function kehta hai like main(){statements.....}

// reason that if else are not the functions bcz they are the internal blocks always.

// IF ELSE ARE THUS CALLLED AS THE "CONTROL STATEMENTS".

// There are two types of statements in c:
// 1. declaration statement 
// 2. action statement

// DECLARATION STATEMENT: (int x) these are the declaration statement and they just done for the compiler and they dont run and the compiler remove it once it got read by the compiler and they not the part of the exceution program.

// ACTION STATEMENTS:(printf and scanf and similar) these are all the statements which are exceutable and are always inside the block and that is why c language is called as the "BLOCK STRUCTURED LANGUAGE".

// NOTE: agar apka block ma bahut sare blocks hai then un sab ka name alag alag hona chahiya

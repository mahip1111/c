// FUNCTION PROTOTYPE:;-
// A function prototype informs the compiler about a function that will be defined later in 
// the program. 

// FUNCTION CALL:-
// A function call instructs the compiler to execute the function's body when the call is  made. 

// FUNCTION DEFINITION:-
// This part contains the exact set of instructions executed during the function call.  
// When a function is called from main(), the main function pauses and temporarily suspends. During this time, control transfers to the called function. Once the function finishes executing, main() resumes.

// IMPORTANT POINTS  
// • Execution of a C program starts from main(). 
// • A C program can have more than one function. 
// • Every function gets called directly or indirectly from main(). 

// TYPES OF FUNCTIONS 
// There are two functions in C. Let's talk about them. 
// 1. Library functions → Commonly required functions grouped together in a library 
// file on disk. 
// 2. User defined function → These are the functions declared and defined by the user. 

// WHY USE FUNCTIONS  
// 1. To avoid rewriting the same logic again and again. 
// 2. To keep track of what we are doing in a program 
// 3. To test and check logic independently.
